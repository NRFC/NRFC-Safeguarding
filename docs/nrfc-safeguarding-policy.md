## Norwich Rugby Football Club Safeguarding Policy

Because children are the future of rugby football it is important that we help them understand rugby union’s values from an early age and set the highest standards as role models, while ensuring their safety and wellbeing.

We aim to help all players to achieve their full potential regardless of age, standard or ability, and by doing this we aim to promote and develop rugby football within the community and encourage maximum participation and enjoyment at all levels

1. Norwich Rugby Football Club acknowledges its responsibility to safeguard the welfare of all children involved in Norwich Rugby Football Club from harm.
1. Norwich RFC confirms that it adheres to the Rugby Football Union’s Safeguarding Policy and the procedures, practices and guidelines and endorse and adopt the Policy Statement contained in that document and any successor policy. All safeguarding concerns will be reported to the RFU Safeguarding team who may require a person, a player or the club to provide information or attend a meeting.
1. A child is anyone under the age of 18 engaged in any rugby union activity.  However, where a 17 year old male player is playing in the adult game it is essential that every reasonable precaution is taken to ensure his safety and wellbeing are protected.
1. The Key Principles of the RFU Safeguarding Policy are that:
    * The welfare of the child is, and must always be, paramount to any other considerations.
    * All participants regardless of age, gender, ability or disability, race, faith, culture, size, shape, language or sexual identity have the right to protection from abuse or harm.
    * All allegations or suspicions of abuse, neglect, harm and poor practice will be taken seriously and responded to swiftly, fairly and appropriately.
    * Working in partnership with other organisations, statutory agencies, parents, carers, children and young people is essential for the welfare of children.
    * Children have a right to expect support, and personal and social development delivered by an appropriately recruited, vetted and managed individual in relation to their participation in rugby union, whether they are playing, volunteering or officiating in the community or professional areas of the sport.
1. Norwich RFC recognises that all children have the right to participate in sport in a safe, positive and enjoyable environment whilst at the same time being protected from abuse, neglect, harm and poor practice.  Norwich RFC recognises that this is the responsibility of everyone involved, in whatever capacity, at the club.
1. Norwich RFC will implement and comply with the RFU Code of Conduct and the Codes of Conduct for Coaches, Spectators and Officials as appropriate.

They will then inform the CB Safeguarding Manager and the RFU Safeguarding Team.

1. All members of Norwich RFC who work with children in Regulated Activity must undertake an RFU Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check in accordance with RFU Regulation 21 and submit an application within four weeks of taking up their role. Failure to do so will result in their being removed from their role.
1.  Norwich RFC will ensure that all its members, whether they are coaches, parents, players or officials will comply with the Best Practice Guidance as issued by the RFU.  In summary, the following are NOT acceptable and will be treated seriously by the club and may result in disciplinary action being taken by the club, the CB or the RFU:
    * Working alone with a child.
    * Consuming alcohol whilst responsible for children.
    * Providing alcohol to children or allowing its supply.
    * Smoking in the presence of children.
    * Humiliating children.
    * Inappropriate or unnecessary physical contact with a child.
    * Participating in, or allowing, contact or physical games with children.
    * Having an intimate or sexual relationship with any child developed as a result of being in a ‘position of trust.’
    * Making sexually explicit comments or sharing sexually explicit material.
1. Norwich RFC manages the changing facilities and arranges for them to be supervised by two DBS checked adults of the appropriate gender for the players using the facilities.  No adult is allowed to be in the changing rooms when they are in use by mini and youth players unless they hold a DBS certificate. Norwich RFC ensures that all its coaches, parents, officials and spectators are aware that adults must not change at the same time, using the same facilities as children.
1. Norwich RFC will ensure that its coaches and team managers and administrators will receive the support and training considered appropriate to their position and role.  The RFU “Managing Challenging Behaviour” Policy has been adopted and circulated amongst the club workforce both, voluntary and paid.
1. Any events held on Norwich RFC premises must comply with this Policy and if appropriate a Safeguarding Plan should be discussed and circulated to those affected.  Any tours, overseas or domestic, undertaken by Norwich RFC must comply with the relevant RFU Regulations and Guidance relating to tours.
1. All allegations of bullying between children should be reported to the Club Safeguarding Officer who will seek the assistance of parents and club volunteers to get the bully / bullies to understand the consequences of their actions and seek appropriate restorative action.
