[Safeguarding Toolkit (pdf)](safeguardingtoolkit.pdf)

Safeguarding means ‘keeping safe’. It covers all aspects of keeping children safe in our club. It is a vital part of what we do in the club at all times. It includes:

* The behaviour of children towards each other
* The behaviour of staff and volunteers towards children
* The behaviour of any visitors or volunteers in our club
* The safety of children on trips out of the club
* Systems and procedures around the club
* The safety of our building and the grounds
* Safe use of the internet and social media
*  Learning about safety through routines and in games and training

Safeguarding is everyone’s responsibility. We all have a statutory duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and at Norwich Rugby Club we take this responsibility seriously. If you have any concerns about a child in our club, you must share this information with one of the club’s Safeguarding Officers. Do not think that your worry is insignificant; we would rather know about something that appears to be minor than miss a situation of concern.

If you think the matter is very serious and may be related to child protection, for example, physical, emotional, sexual abuse or neglect, you must find one of the designated professionals listed opposite immediately to share your concern. Any concerns you have or anything a child says to you must remain confidential once you have informed a club safeguarding officer. If you are unable to locate them ask a member of the club staff to find them and to ask them to speak with you immediately about a confidential and urgent matter. Any concerns regarding a member of staff, volunteer or parent should be reported immediately to a club safeguarding officer. A concern about a club safeguarding officer should be reported to the RFU Regional safeguarding lead. Alternatively, you can contact the RFU Senior Safeguarding team on 0208 831 7479.

## Mobile Phones & Photographs

Before taking any photographs of the children you should first check with the team manager/administrator to ensure that there are no children who should not be photographed. Photographs that are taken should not be shared on social media other than sites or pages that Norwich Rugby Club administers. Most year groups have a Facebook page but check with the team manager/administrator.

## Health & Safety

Please report any issues or concerns to a Club Safeguarding Officers (Toby Batch, tobias@neontribe.co.uk; Jon Bugg, jonbugg7@gmail.com; Jules Waterman, jules.lg@hotmail.co.uk; Claire Honess, clairehoness@googlemail.com). First Aid kits can be found behind the bar and with each age groups team manager/administrator.

## Safeguarding Behaviour

All staff, visitors and volunteers are expected to treat each other, and the children with respect and to behave professionally. Visitors and volunteers should avoid being alone with children unless they have a registered DBS check with Norwich Rugby Club. This includes tak- ing children to the toilet. This protects adults from false allegations. If you are asked to supervise children, and you do not have a DBS check with us, please inform the Safeguarding Officer. Every adult in the club has a responsibility to keep children safe. If you are concerned about anything you see or hear around our club, you must let a safeguarding officer know. This includes the behaviour of staff or volunteers. If you have any ideas about how we might make our club even safer please let the safeguarding team know. At Norwich Rugby Club we work together to safeguard and promote the welfare of all our children.
